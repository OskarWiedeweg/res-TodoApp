# res-TodoApp

This is a little research, learning project of mine.
Now you might be asking, another ``TodoApp``?!
Aren't there plenty of tutorials out there?
Yes, but I'm trying to build a fullstack solution to refresh my mind a bit.

My plan is to build this application with a restful backend, that persists all
todo lists and makes them accessible to friends, co-workers or whatsoever.
Also, I wanted to create an app for the major mobile platforms like iOS and Android
and use their native language. Maybe I include a desktop version (or a web version) later on.

## Requirements

So at first I wanted to set my self some requirements, to make this more challenging.

1. The code should be as much tested as it could be (unit, integration, stress tests)
2. The UI should not look like it was made from my 9-year-old me in the art class
3. The code should be clean. Meaning each language conventions should be respected and best practices for code asthetic should get used.
